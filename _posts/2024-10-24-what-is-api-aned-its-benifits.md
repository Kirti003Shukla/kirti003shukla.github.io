API[Application Programming Interface]
It is a set of rules which allows one piece of software to interact with another software.For the interaction, it defines the methods and data formats.
Methods- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
Formats- XML, JSON
For example: When a client wants to access specific data from the server, it sends the request through API. The API processes the request and returns the data in the required format.

Real Life Example-
Third-Party Login

Many web applications allow users to sign in with their Facebook, Google, Github, or other accounts instead of making an account directly. But that doesn’t mean they’re getting access to your social media. Instead, the app makes an API call to check if the user is already signed in to the third-party website. The API makes the confirmation, then handles the authentication in the app’s place.


Ecommerce

Do any online shopping outside of Amazon and you’ll see a “pay with PayPal” option at checkout. The API that powers this works similarly to the third-party login APIs mentioned above. Again, the store doesn’t directly access your PayPal account. It instead sends the purchase order to the PayPal API and PayPal handles the rest of the transaction.
